# The Sands Project

Tiny quality-of-life and utility mods, that aren't big enough to have their own repository.

## Better Fonts

Adds and uses two new fonts:
- Munro Extended - Munro, but with added cyrillic characters;
- Fusion Pixel - pixel font for Chinese and Korean languages;

Also fixes several issues in the Settings menu.

## Blinking Mod

Makes everyone blink.

## Crispy Mod

Makes everything crispy, deepfried.

`Insert` — Brightness +1; `Delete` — Brigthness -1;  
`Home` — Saturation +1; `End` — Saturation -1;  
`PageUp` — Contrast +1; `PageDown` — Contrast -1;  
Default values: 15 brightness, 20 saturation, 20 contrast. 10 is normal.

## Dancing Mod

Dance on `J`.

## Demolish That Freaking Wall

Demolishes that annoying wall on the way to the Hacker.

## Don't Send My Data

Prevents the game from sending any analytics from your computer.

## Enable RL Debug Tools

Checks the RogueLibs' `DebugFlags.EnableTools` flag and enables some tools:
- `[DEBUG] +10 Nuggets` button in the Loadouts;

## Immediate Logger

Loggers commonly implement a writing buffer, so that they don't have to constantly write logs to the file, every time a Log method is called. This one doesn't implement it, so it should catch any and all logs, even if the game or your computer crashes.

## Jumping Mod

Jump on `Left Alt`. Makes you go really fast, unbalanced.

## More Mouse Controls

Adds functionality to the side buttons that some fancy mice have - forward and backwards movement.  
The speed is unbalanced, made primarily for one-hand mod debugging.

## Snap

Adjust the camera zoom with numpad `+`/`-`. `Enter` resets the zoom.  
`Print` creates a 4x-resolution snapshot of the screen (without the interface).
