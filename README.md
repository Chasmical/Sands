# The Sands Project

Tiny quality-of-life and utility mods, that aren't big enough to have their own repository.

## Demolish That Freaking Wall

Demolishes that annoying wall on the way to the Hacker.

## Don't Send My Data

Prevents the game from sending any analytics from your computer.

## Enable RL Debug Tools

Checks the RogueLibs' `DebugFlags.EnableTools` flag and enables some tools:
- `[DEBUG] +10 Nuggets` button in the Loadouts;

## Jumping Mod

Jump on `Left Alt`. Makes you go really fast, unbalanced.

## More Mouse Controls

Adds functionality to the side buttons that some fancy mice have - forward and backwards movement.  
The speed is unbalanced, made primarily for one-hand mod debugging.

## Snap

Adjust the camera zoom with numpad `+`/`-`. `Enter` resets the zoom.  
`Print` creates a 4x-resolution snapshot of the screen (without the interface).
